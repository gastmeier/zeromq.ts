# zeromq.ts

A typed [zeromq.js based on version 5.x](https://github.com/zeromq/zeromq.js/tree/5.x).

This project was started because the original library does not offer any API documentation nor other resources which would suffice to explain how to use it. TypeScript type definitions are also missing which means that the programmer has to dive into the source code to know which constructs exist and how to use it. On top of that there are ZMQ specifics which the developer has to know to use the library the right way.

This wrapper for zeromq.js tries to overcome those weaknesses by offering a typed interface and by providing the original ZMQ documentation in the right spots. Use a modern IDE like VS Code to take advantage of this. It also hides some ZMQ details which further lowers the entry barrier.

## Quickstart

```typescript
import { ProtocolType, SocketType, ZeroMq } from 'zeromq.ts'

let zmq = new ZeroMq(SocketType.subscriber, ProtocolType.tcp, '127.0.0.1:27010', {
  plain_username: 'user',
  plain_password: 'password'
})

zmq.onConnected(() => zmq.subscribe(''))
zmq.onMessage((message: Buffer) => console.log(message.toString()))

zmq.connect()
```

## Overview

`ZeroMq` is the main class to work with. It represents one zeromq.js `Socket` object. The constructor will create that for you.

```typescript
import { ProtocolType, SocketType, ZeroMq } from 'zeromq.ts'

let zmq = new ZeroMq(SocketType.subscriber, ProtocolType.tcp, '127.0.0.1:27010', {
  plain_username: 'user',
  plain_password: 'password'
})
```

The 4th parameter is an object representing options. Use your IDE to find out which there are and also read the documentation there. Everything is well documented.

### ZMQ events

You can attach arbitrary many listeners to each one of the following ZMQ events. Also every method will automatically initialize the mandatory ZMQ monitor for you.

```typescript
zmq.onConnected(listener)
zmq.onConnectDelayed(listener)
zmq.onConnectRetried(listener)
zmq.onListening(listener)
zmq.onBindFailed(listener)
zmq.onAccepted(listener)
zmq.onAcceptFailed(listener)
zmq.onClose(listener)
zmq.onCloseFailed(listener)
zmq.onDisconnected(listener)
```

These events are named differently in the original library which named them incorrectly regarding the standard.

### ZMQ messages

You can subscribe to messages using a certain filter. It is not

```typescript
zmq.subscribe('') // registers to all messages
zmq.onMessage(listener)
```

### ZMQ send

Sending messages.

```typescript
zmq.send()
```

### Version

You can find out the version by importing the corresponding variable.

```typescript
import {Â version } from 'zeromq.ts'
```

### Missing things

There are still some minor things missing which can be added easily which i will do if there is any interest. Just create an issue on GitHub.
